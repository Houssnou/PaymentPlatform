# PaymentPlatform
Asp.Net Core Web API and Angular 7 CRUD.

This is a play box for a project picked on Upwork.com to implement a payment system to an existing restaurant order taking Web solution.

This feature adds CRUD Operations to the existing solution - Insert, update, delete and retrieve are implemented in Asp.Net Core Web API with Angular 7. First of all we'll build a Web API project in Asp.Net Core with required methods at server side using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server DB. Then Angular 7 Project consumes those methods from the client side. 


Tools & Tech Used :Asp.Net Core, Angular 7 CLI, EF Core, VS Code, Visual Studio, SSMS, Postman.

Coming Next:
Implementing  ASP.NET Identity before anything to secure our APIs.
Adding this feature to the existing (Lot of things to change...) starting by: 
  Redesigning the current DB by adding few models using EF Core code-first approach.
  Adding the API Controllers the exiting.
  Moving legacy App from Angular 6 to 7 (without breaking it).
  Retouching the UX/UI using Ang Material.
  Updating some packages to take advantage of current newer npms versions.
